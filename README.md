[![clash royale](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clash%20Royale-2.0.0-brightgreen.svg?style=flat")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashroyale&hl=en)

A TCP & DNS Proxy written with Typescript. Originally I developed it for sniffing packets on the popular mobile game Clash Royale, but it can be used for any other game / application too. It decrypts in- & outgoing messages and decodes the messages according to a given schema. 

## TODO
* Created type definitions for native-dns
* Write documentation (how to use it, contributing, credits)
* Inject & block packets for in & outgoing messages
